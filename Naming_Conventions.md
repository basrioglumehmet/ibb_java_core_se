# Naming Conventions in Programming

In programming, different naming conventions are used to identify variables, classes, functions, etc. Below are the three common naming conventions:

## 1. camelCase
- **Definition**: In **camelCase**, the first word starts with a lowercase letter, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter, without spaces or special characters.
- **Usage**: Commonly used for variables, functions, and method names in programming.
- **Example**:
    - `myVariableName`
    - `calculateTotalAmount`
    - `getUserData`

## 2. PascalCase
- **Definition**: In **PascalCase**, each word starts with an uppercase letter, including the first one. Like **camelCase**, there are no spaces or special characters.
- **Usage**: Typically used for class names, types, and namespaces.
- **Example**:
    - `MyClass`
    - `EmployeeDetails`
    - `ProductCatalog`

## 3. kebab-case
- **Definition**: In **kebab-case**, all words are lowercase and separated by hyphens (`-`), without spaces or special characters.
- **Usage**: Often used in URLs, filenames, and CSS classes.
- **Example**:
    - `my-variable-name`
    - `calculate-total-amount`
    - `product-catalog`

## Summary
- **camelCase**: First word lowercase, subsequent words uppercase (e.g., `myVariableName`).
- **PascalCase**: All words start with uppercase letters (e.g., `MyClass`).
- **kebab-case**: All lowercase letters, words separated by hyphens (e.g., `my-variable-name`).

Each naming convention serves a different purpose, mainly depending on the context in which they are used (variables, classes, URLs, etc.).
