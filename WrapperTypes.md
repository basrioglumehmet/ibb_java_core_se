# Java: Wrapper Types

In Java, **wrapper types** are used to wrap primitive types into objects. They provide methods to convert between primitives and objects, and they allow primitive types to be treated as objects. This is useful when working with classes and collections, as Java collections cannot store primitive types directly.

## Wrapper Classes for Primitive Types:
- **byte** → `Byte`
- **short** → `Short`
- **int** → `Integer`
- **long** → `Long`
- **float** → `Float`
- **double** → `Double`
- **char** → `Character`
- **boolean** → `Boolean`

## Key Concepts:
- **Autoboxing**: Converting a primitive type to a wrapper type.
- **Unboxing**: Converting a wrapper type to a primitive type.
- **Nullability**: Wrapper types can be `null`.

Thanks for spending time.
